# README (Jessica Wang, COMP0020)

## Overview
This git repository contains all of my assignments for my Web Progamming class, taken in the summer of 2018. You can find:

* MBTA
This application uses the Google Maps API to map the MBTA Red Line and updates their schedules in real time. The application also tells the client the T stop closest to their current location, as well as tracks the most
popular stations clicked through a database in MongoDB. 
I also implemented its server using Node JS, Heroku.

* Messages
This assignment explores how XMLHttpRequests work, as well as how to parse JSON data.

* Responsive
This assignment explores media queries and CSS Sprites.

* Rickroll
This is an annotated video of every stanza of "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley.

* Security 
This webpage explores the security vulnerabilities found in a web application. Read it to see me break things!

## What I Enjoyed
I particularly enjoyed the 'security' assignment, as it was something I had never done before. Security, for me, used to be an afterthought - after 
this assignment, I was both wowed and alarmed by how easy it was to break something or affect other clients using the same application.

## My Growth
I knew a tiny bit of HTML and CSS before taking this course, but in six weeks I feel as if I have grown tremendously. Now I know how design a webpage, scale it for
different screen widths, work with an API, learn programming languages on the fly, implement a server, and tighten web application security. Moreover, it made me think critically about
how an application works, both client side and server side, which deepened my understanding of it. Most of all, I appreciate how this course promotes
learning by doing. I found that that was more useful for me as a learner, instead of the rote memorization of facts. 

## The Most Important Thing(s) I Learned
If there is anything I took away from this course, it is twofold:
1. Security should not be an afterthought. In fact, it should be constantly running through one's mind during the design process for an application, so one is not scrambling to
patch holes after they finish writing it. In the "security" assignment, I managed to crash an entire database in one line of code, which took less than a minute.
Insecure web applications are not fair for the clients using it, and one should never give other clients the benefit of the doubt (never, ever trust user input! Unfortunately, not everyone
in this world is a Nice Guy).

2. It's okay to Google aggressively. Sometimes, hacking away at a problem for hours can be solved by just the right search. Don't feel dumb if you don't understand things right away, because
all of the brain racking pays off once you understand everything behind the inner workings of your application. I ran into this problem a lot during the MBTA assignment trying to learn how to use
MongoDB, but in the end, I gained a pretty solid understanding of it and have a working application to boot!

## The Future
So, what now? 
* This course piqued my interest in web security, so I plan to continue that in my next course of the summer, COMP0116.
* I want to learn how to prettify my web applications! In my free time, I will be working on my personal website jessicaxwang.github.io, learning
new things about HTML and CSS to try and make it look as presentable and aesthetically pleasing as possible.

Thank you for reading about my journey through the first six weeks of the Tufts summer session! I hope you enjoy browsing this repository.
