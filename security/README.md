# Jessica Wang (Lab 13)

Everything has been correctly implemented.

For this assignment, I talked with my friend and classmate Michael Thramann quite a bit. We shared our tactics for how to best destroy the web app, as well as what security issues we both were looking at. I also credit this webpage for my idea to insert deserialized JSON into the database:

Gabe Joseph's Spring 2013 report also helped immensely.

*SIDENOTE: While I tried all that I could to find loopholes in this web app, I realize that I could have built my own, local version to work with. That way, I could have peered into the database itself. I will keep this in mind the next time I perform a security assessment, whether in industry or for an assignment.*

Approximately 4 hours spent.
